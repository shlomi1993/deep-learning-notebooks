If A has fewer dimensions than `B`, it prepends singleton dimensions (size 1) to `A` and reshapes it accordingly. Then, for each dimension where `A` has size 1 and `B` has a larger size, it replicates A using `torch.cat` to match `B`'s size in that dimension. If `A` initially has more dimensions than `B` or if the final shape doesn't match `B`'s shape, the function raises an ExpansionError.
